### ShadowBox – AI-Powered Silent Cyberattack Simulation Tool

ShadowBox is a Python-based tool that simulates silent cyberattacks within isolated Docker environments. It uses OpenAI’s GPT to analyze vulnerabilities and supports secure logging to Google Cloud. Built with FastAPI, it provides a modern and scalable API interface.

### Features

- Silent cyberattack simulation in Docker containers  
- AI-powered vulnerability analysis using OpenAI GPT  
- Optional Google Cloud Logging integration  
- REST API with versioning and health checks  
- CI/CD ready with sample GitHub Actions workflow  
- Dockerized for easy deployment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer  
- Docker (running locally)  
- OpenAI API key  
- Google Cloud Service Account JSON (optional, for logging)  
- Git

### Installation

Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
Step 2: Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install fastapi uvicorn docker openai google-cloud-logging python-dotenv
Environment Setup
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

env
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_your_gcp_service_account.json
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your_gcp_project_id
Alternatively, you can export these variables in your shell.

Running the Application
Start the FastAPI application locally using:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn CyberSecurity:app --reload
Visit http://localhost:8000 to interact with the service.

API Endpoints
GET /api/v1/simulation/health
Verifies the service is running.

GET /api/v1/simulation/version
Returns the current API version.

POST /api/v1/simulation/start
Starts a simulated cyberattack.

Request Body Example
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "environment_image": "python:3.10-slim",
  "attack_type": "privilege_escalation"
}
Example cURL Command
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/simulation/start" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"environment_image": "python:3.10-slim", "attack_type": "privilege_escalation"}'
Docker Deployment
To run using Docker:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t shadowbox .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env shadowbox
CI/CD
A sample GitHub Actions workflow is provided in the code. It includes automated:

Building

Testing

Deployment to Google Cloud Run

You can adapt this workflow to any CI/CD system such as GitLab CI, CircleCI, or Jenkins.

Notes
The simulation logic is mocked for safety. Extend the simulate_attack function for realistic use cases.

Google Cloud Logging is optional. If not configured, logs will be printed to the console.

An OpenAI API key is required to enable the AI-powered vulnerability analysis.
